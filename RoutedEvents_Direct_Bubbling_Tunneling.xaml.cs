//WPF gives us a number of different mechanisms for handling events – they are bubbling, tunneling, and direct.
//These are all known as Routed events.

//Direct event

//You are probably already used to the direct routed event. This is where the item itself handles the event that occurred. 
//A good example would be handling he onClick-event of a mouse button in standard WinForms. 
//This is where the event is raised in the GUI item and gets handled by said GUI element.

//Bubbling Event

//Now we all like some bubbles in one form or another. Bubbling happens when the event is not handled by the element
//(say a textbox) and the event "bubbles" its way up the UI containers which hold it. 
//For example, let's say you have a window that contains a panel and inside that panel you have a grid and inside
//the grid you have a textbox. If the event is not handled by the textbox, then it moves, is passed or "bubbles" up to 
//the grid level (as the grid contains the textbox), if it is not handled at that level then the event bubbles
//further up the "tree" (known as a visual tree) to the panel where it may or may not be handled. 
//This process continues until it is handled or the event "escapes" the top most element.
//Examples of a bubbling event would be something like a MouseButtonDown event. Or a Keydown event.

//Tunneling

//Tunneling is the opposite of Bubbling. So instead of an event going "up" the visual tree, the event travels down the
//visual tree toward the element that is considered the source. The standard WPF naming definition of a tunneling event
//is that they all start with "preview" for example previewdownkey and previewmousebuttondown. You can catch them
//on their way to the "target" element and handle it. An example for this might be perhaps you have some controls 
//inside a grid control and for some reason you have decided that no control within that grid will be allowed to have
//the letter "t" reach it.
